i== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) and Cosign Integration

=== Deepening Security Layers

In the context of ever-evolving cyber threats, integrating Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) with Cosign in our OpenShift environment signifies a strategic enhancement in our security posture. We'll examine how this integration offers not just an additional verification layer for our container images but also a more robust, holistic defense mechanism. By aligning ACS with Cosign, we ensure that every container image deployed in our system is doubly checked for its security and compliance, aligning perfectly with our stringent security mandates.
